# About the program

Thnaks you for the interest in my project. The thing is that recently I learned SQL-language and administration of mySQL database and I wanted to figure out how to implement databases in my C# projects.
As I haven't got any server, the database is hosted on localhost (the app won't work on your PC if you don't have the same localhost settings).

There I am trying to use __mySQL__ database in __C#__ project for the first time (for this objective I selected WPF because it is less complex than ASP), along with this I'll try to test some new features in WPF UI design.

## Features:

The main idea was to crate a __simple autorization form__ with opportunity to __register new users__ and store all the data in mySQL database.
There is also an option that can show a __list of all the users and their Ids__, or user can __delete their account__.
In total I worked with data selection commands, deleting and adding new data in database.
I also tried some new WPF UI-design features to make my app more user-friendly.

Now I'm thinking about adding some filter options and search in the list of users. 

Write me your thoughts about the code and my app. I am beginner and any code-review is very useful.
